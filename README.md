3d-print stuff

Here's my self made 3d printable stuff.
It's largely openscad files (.scad) and some .stl files

Using openscad (http://www.openscad.org/) you can generate stl files on your own.

Then import the stl files into your favorite slicer, and you should be ready to print.

Directories:
- libraries - any openscad libraries I've setup
- beadtray - a project for my wife, a 6 bowl beadtray with screw on lid
  - This project uses a third party library, "threads" from http://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/ 
- NewPrusaKnob - a new knob for the Prusa i3 mk3.  
  - This project uses the third party library for knurling a cylinder: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9095
- parametric\_peg - a module for creating a peg with cap, barb, and bearing space - created as a repair for a whirlpool fridge door.
