3d-print stuff

Here's my self made 3d printable stuff.
It's largely openscad files (.scad) and some .stl files

Using openscad (http://www.openscad.org/) you can generate stl files on your own.

Then import the stl files into your favorite slicer, and you should be ready to print.

Directories:
- libraries - any openscad libraries I've setup
- beadtray - a project for my wife, a 6 bowl beadtray with screw on lid
  - This project uses a third party library, "threads" from http://dkprojects.net/openscad-threads/
